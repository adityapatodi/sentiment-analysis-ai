# sentiment-analysis-ai
First AI Project: This project is a simple AI system that classifies sentences as positive or negative. It was created to explore how machine learning models learn patterns from text data.

The user provides labelled sentences as training data. The text is converted into numerical features using TD-IDF. A Naive Bayes classifier is trained on this data and then used to classify new sentences.

- Python
- scikit-learn
- TF-IDF Vectoriser
- Multinomial Naive Bayes

1. Run the Python file.
2. Paste training data in the provided format.
3. Enter new sentences to classify.

Sample training data is provided in 'sample_training_data.txt'.
