# project aim
The aim of this project was to understand how a basic AI system learns from text data and makes predictions. I wanted to move beyond theory and build a working machine learning model that classifies sentences as positive or negative.

# learning aspect
Through this project, I learned how text must be converted into numerical features before a machine learning model can process it. I understood how TF-IDF represents the importance of words and how a Naive Bayes classifier uses probabilities to make predictions. I also learned the difference between training data and test data and why data quality matters.

# challenges
One of the main challenges was understanding how the AI learns rather than memorising sentences. At first, I thought the model was recognising whole sentences but later I realised that it learns patterns in words. I also faced practical issues such as installing external libraries and handling user input correctly and efficiently. I overcame these challenges by breaking the problem into smaller steps and testing each part of the code independently. I experimented with different training sentences and observed how predictions changed which helped me understand the learning process more clearly.

# improvements
If I continued this project, I would improve it by using a larger dataset, automatic data input from files and experiment with different models to compare accuracies. I would also like to visualise results and evaluate the model more formally, understanding the efficiencies and negatives of the system currently used.
